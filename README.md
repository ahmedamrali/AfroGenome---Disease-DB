This is a project I wrorked on in one of my courses in my third year, the course related to using python in computational biology.

Changes will be made in the future and these changes include:

  1. Making a better read.me file
  2. making the database cleaner and more usable.

There might be more changes or there might not be.

To put it simply, the that has part 1 in its name is the file that uses selenium to browse scientific databases and download excel files from it to extract data from it and store it while the code is working.
The next part would be running the file that has part 2 in it, make sure that you are running both files in the same folder becasuew the second file needs the data that file one makes, 
the second file is the one responsible for making the databases using SQL, the database is unfortunately sloppy and not optimized at all, that was due to being tight on time, it will be enhanced in the future.


Finally, you will notice big comments in the coding files, these are to explain what each line does and will not be removed incase someone wants to understand this code on their own.

Thanks for reading and have a lovely day.
